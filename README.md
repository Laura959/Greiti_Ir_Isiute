## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to our project "Greiti ir Isiute".

## About Project

The main purpose of this project is to create new projects and tasks as well managing them.  After we create a new project, we can delete it, edit the existing information and download it in CSV format which will display the name of the project, description, project status, finished tasks, and total tasks. If we click on the existing project name we automatically go to the task window where we can create tasks. Once we have created the task, we can delete them, edit the title, description, priority, and status of the task, and we can also download them in CSV format. Our project has a search bar that will help you to find the necessary projects and tasks faster.

## Start-up instructions

To run our project you will need to download a program called XAMPP. You can download it through this link [xampp link](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) click on this link and select your operating system and press the button "download". After downloading, install the program. Also, you will need to install another program called GIT. [Git link](https://git-scm.com/downloads). After you install XAMPP run it and you should see this view.

## About Your Team


Our team representative is Laura who diligently showed the Jira screen every morning and every sprint represented our team. Also, her knowledge in both back-end and front-end programming made everything much easier.

Our team designer is Ieva with her design skills, it became much easier to implement this project.

Our team engine is Vytautas, with Vytautas knowledge, nothing was impossible, no matter how difficult the task was Vytautas already had a plan on how to overcome it.

Another very valuable teammate is Aurimas. He did a lot of back-end programming and thanks to him functions like "delete", "edit" in our project works like a dream.

The most helpful person on our team was Eduardas, always determined to help. Although, he doesn't like CSS, but loooves back-end.

The calmest person on our team was Andrius. But you know how they say, the more silent you are, the more determined (or maybe dangerous) you are. Our team ninja.

And clearly, the best testers who noticed all the problems (I wish on some bugs they could just let it slide, but noooo) were Elonas and Evaldas. All jokes aside, they did an amazing job, because they see what we don't.

And of course.. the one and only. Our team leader - Justina. She helped us so much, and her critique was very useful and very helpful. So on our team's behalf, we are very thankful.
